# Irontemple
Iron Temple is a sacred space for code and muscle. Built with Next.js, and Tailwind — because why not make your gym app as shredded as your quads?  From workout exploration to session booking, it’s got everything... except full responsiveness (coming soon, LOL).  Server-side gains. Client-side DOMination.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
